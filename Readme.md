Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:

  git clone https://github.com/jatin99/Test-Automation-Framework.git

  cd Test-Automation-Framework
Running Tests on LambdaTest:

     mvn test  -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=true -DisHeadless=false -X
Running Tests on Chrome browser on Local Machine in Headless Mode:

     mvn test  -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=false -DisHeadless=true -X
Reports & Logs
-Reports: After execution, a detailed HTML report will be generated at ./report.html.

The report contains information on test cases executed, passed, failed, and skipped, along with screenshots for failed tests.

Logs:
Logs are created during the test execution and stored in the ./logs/ directory.

Integrated the project Github Actions
This automation framework is integrated with github actions. The tests will be executed at 11:30PM IST every single day.
